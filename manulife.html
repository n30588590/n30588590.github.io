<h4>Application Requirements</h4>
<p>Submit applications by <span class='date'>2024-03-31T00:00:00</span>.</p>
<p>Applications include a form and an under-500-word essay or under-3-minute video detailing how the death of a parent or legal guardian without adequate life insurance affected the family's financial situation and what the applicant has done to provide for themselves and other family members because of the financial challenges their family has faced.  Recipients will be selected based on the compelling nature of the story, its instructiveness with regards to the importance of life insurance, and the determination of the student to not allow their loss to prevent the realisation of their goal of higher education.</p>
<h4>Applicant Restrictions</h4>
<p>Applicants must have experienced the death of a parent or legal guardian who had little to no life insurance coverage.</p>
